## Column graph of Texas oil spills 2010-2016
```{r}
oil_spills <- read_csv("oil_spills.csv")

# Subset dataframe with only data from Texas
df <- oil_spills %>%
  filter(`Accident State` == "TX" & `Accident Year` < 2017) %>%
  group_by(`Accident Year`) %>%
  summarise(Loss = sum(`Net Loss (Barrels)`))

colnames(df) <- c("Year", "Loss")

ggplot(df, aes(x=Year, y=Loss)) +
  geom_col()
```

## Leaflet plot of spill locations in Texas in 2016
```{r}
df_loc <- oil_spills %>%
  filter(`Accident State` == "TX" & `Accident Year` == 2016) %>%
  select(Latitude, Longitude, `Net Loss (Barrels)`)

colnames(df_loc) <- c("latitude","longitude", "net_loss")

oil_sf <- st_as_sf(df_loc, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) # convert data into spatial features data

# class(oil_sf) # now it's recognized as simple features data!

leaflet(oil_sf) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers()

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
